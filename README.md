# EntropyAudit

entropyaudit reads Python source and reports where a program leans on
randomness that is not random enough to hold up security. It parses each file
with the standard library `ast` module and looks for predictable seeds, use of
the `random` module where `secrets` is required, time seeded generators, reused
nonce or IV constants, fixed salts, and weak hash choices for password handling.
Every finding carries a written exploitability rationale, so the report explains
why a pattern is dangerous instead of listing bare codes.

## Why randomness bugs survive review

Randomness failures are quiet. A call to `random.getrandbits(128)` looks like it
produces a large unpredictable number, and it does produce a large number. The
problem is that `random` is a Mersenne Twister: after an observer collects a few
hundred outputs, the internal state can be recovered and every future output
predicted. Nothing in the line reads as wrong, the code runs, the tests pass,
and the token looks fine in a log. The defect only becomes visible when someone
attacks it.

The same quietness applies to the other patterns this tool checks. A seed of
`1337` produces the same stream on every run. A nonce assigned to a constant
repeats on every encryption. A salt hard coded once is shared by every user. A
password hashed with `md5` is one commodity GPU away from a wordlist. Each of
these is a single line that behaves correctly in a demo and fails only against
an adversary who is not in the room during code review.

entropyaudit exists to make these lines visible before that adversary finds
them. It does not prove exploitability in a given deployment; it flags the
pattern and explains the exploit path so a reviewer can decide. The written
rationale is the point: a bare "CWE-338" tells a reviewer nothing they can act
on, while "Mersenne Twister state can be recovered from a few hundred outputs,
so use `secrets`" tells them exactly what to change and why.

## Install

Install from the project directory:

```
pip install .
```

Or run it in place without installing. On Windows PowerShell:

```
$env:PYTHONPATH="src"
python -m entropyaudit scan samples
```

On a POSIX shell:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python -m entropyaudit scan samples
```

Installing also registers an `entropyaudit` console script through the
`[project.scripts]` entry in `pyproject.toml`, so `entropyaudit scan samples`
works once the package is on the path.

## Commands

Four subcommands. Each takes a file or a directory; a directory is walked in
sorted, deterministic order and every `.py` file under it is scanned.

| Command   | Argument    | What it prints                                                 |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scan`    | path        | One block per finding: location, category, code, and rationale.|
| `report`  | path        | A grouped report: counts by class, then findings under each.   |
| `explain` | rule id (optional) | The rationale for one rule, or all six when omitted.    |
| `version` | none        | The package version string.                                    |

## The rule set

Six rules, EA001 through EA006. Each entry below states what the rule matches in
the AST, the CWE class it maps to, why the pattern is exploitable, and a short
before and after pair. The severity and CWE mapping come from `patterns.py`; the
rationale text comes from `rationale.py`.

### EA001: predictable seed passed to a random generator

Matches `random.seed(<constant>)` or `Random(<constant>)` where the argument is
a literal constant. Class: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, CWE-330,
severity high.

Exploitability: a generator seeded with a literal produces the same sequence on
every run. An attacker who knows or guesses the seed reproduces every value the
program emits, including tokens, IDs, and choices meant to be unguessable.

```python
random.seed(1337)                  # before
token = random.getrandbits(128)
token = secrets.token_bytes(16)    # after (import secrets)
```

### EA002: random module used on a security-relevant path

Matches a call into the `random` module (`random`, `randint`, `randrange`,
`choice`, `choices`, `sample`, `shuffle`, `uniform`, `getrandbits`, `randbytes`)
whose result flows into a security relevant identifier. Class: Use of
Cryptographically Weak PRNG, CWE-338, severity high.

Exploitability: `random` is a Mersenne Twister, not a cryptographic generator.
After observing a few hundred outputs an attacker can recover the internal state
and predict all future outputs.

```python
session_token = random.getrandbits(128)   # before
session_token = secrets.token_hex(16)      # after (import secrets)
```
